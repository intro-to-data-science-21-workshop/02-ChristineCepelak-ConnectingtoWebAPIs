# Summary
This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop run at the Hertie School, Berlin in November 2021. The student-run workshop is part of the course Introduction to Data Science taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2021.

# Session contents
This session will introduce you to gathering data via APIs (Application Programming Interface). Finding complete, up-to-date data is a critical part of the data science workflow, and web APIs provide organized datasets directly from the source! Learning to connect to an organization's API will allow you to find valuable datasets and refrain from duplicating efforts already mastered by companies like Google (ex: Google Maps). 

# Main learning objectives
The goals of this session are to (1) understand what an API is, (2) show you how to connect and query one, and (3) give you examples of valuable APIs and further reading.
